The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a custom directive.  Suppose you have a custom directive like this:

```html
<div class="container mx-auto @apply md:px-6">
</div>
```

Tailwind might not correctly apply the `md:px-6` class, leading to unexpected spacing. This often happens due to the order of operations or conflicts with other directives.
