Instead of using `@apply`, directly apply the Tailwind classes:

```html
<div class="container mx-auto md:px-6">
</div>
```

This approach eliminates the inconsistency by relying on Tailwind's built-in class application mechanism.  Avoid nesting `@apply` directives within custom directives or classes for improved reliability.
